# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

This was my 1st FrontEnd Mentor challenge using React and BEM.

Felt a little awkward getting started, could of had it done much faster with vanilla HTML and CSS but this was great practice building react components even had results dynamically populate using props.

Good practice!
